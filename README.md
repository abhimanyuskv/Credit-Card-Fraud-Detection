# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. We utilize a compressed version of the credit card transaction dataset to train and evaluate various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The analysis aims to improve the accuracy of fraud detection and prevent fraudulent activities.
